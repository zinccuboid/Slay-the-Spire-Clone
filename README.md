This is a simple, text based clone of the video game Slay the Spire,
by Mega Crit. It is a turn based game where the user fights enemies by
using a randomised deck of cards representing their possible game
actions. The player draws 5 cards from their deck at the start of each
turn and discards their hand at the end of their turn. If they would
draw a card and their deck is empty, the discard pile is shuffled, and
becomes the draw pile.
